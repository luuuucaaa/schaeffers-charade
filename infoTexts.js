    "gameTypeSelection": "Choose whether you want to play the sonic or visual version of the game. In the sonic version you will create a scene by placing sound clips around a virtual space. When your scene is finished it will be presented to others as an audio file. So they can guess the scene only by hearing the combination of sounds. In the visual version you are placing symbols instead of the sound clips to realize the scene. Other players will receive a muted visual representation of your scene (a short video clip) and will try to figure out the intended scene solely based on the placed symbols without any sound. By hovering over any of the moving squares with your mouse you will get a preview of some of the included sounds in the game and how they will sound in the virtual space. By clicking on the information button this and other instructional messages will close or show up again. If you need help you will most likely find the answers here. For best experience use the Fullscreen Button to resize the window to your screen size.",
    "audioSettings": "Here you can choose between binaural or multichannel audio. If you are playing with headphones (recommended) choose the binaural version. This will recreate a three-dimensional space inside your headphones so the created scenes will sound more realistic. Multichannel-audio has to be chosen if you are playing with a multi-speaker setup with at least four speakers around you. This way the scene will be represented inside your room and can be used for a local variation of the game when playing with people being together in the same room. (Future feature) The Back Button will bring you back to the previous screen.",
    "menu": "By pressing Start the game will begin. Each game consists of three rounds. So you have to create three different scenes per game.",
    "taskSelection": "At the beginning of each round you will have to pick one of three tasks which you have to realize in a scene using the sound clips or visual objects. The other players will have to guess which scene was meant out of those three, so also keep in mind how your chosen scene differs from the other two.",
    "audioGame": "After choosing the task you have to create an auditory scene representing it. Therefore you can pick any of the sound clips from the two bottom rows of squares and place them in one of the six grids shown. The triangle represents you as the listener and you can place sounds around you. Sounds closer to the triangle will be louder than those placed further away. You can pre-listen to the sounds by hovering over the squares with your mouse. If you want to use a sound twice you can duplicate it by double clicking on the square. If you want to listen to all sounds inside a grid just move your mouse to it and it will play all sounds from this grid. The six grids are laid out as a timeline, therefore it is possible to let a sound object move through the space by placing the same object on different positions in each grid. The six grids will be played on after the other starting from the upper left and ending at the lower right grid. You can start the playback by pressing the “Play Scenes” button. If you are happy with your scene you can submit it using the according button in the upper right corner. After submitting you will have to choose the next task for the upcoming round. By pressing the “Menu” button you can go back to choose another task for the current round. The “Reset” button will reset the scene to the default state and you can start over.",
    "visualGame": "After choosing the task you have to create a visual scene representing it. Therefore you can pick any of the visual objects from the two bottom rows of squares and place them in one of the six grids shown. The triangle represents you and you can place objects around you. If you want to use an object twice you can duplicate it by double clicking on the square.
